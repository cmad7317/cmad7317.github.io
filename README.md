Hello random internet traveller,

My name is Christian and I'm screwing around with
web development. I'm using Khan Academy to learn
how to program HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm 
also in university for comp sci, but the 
curriculum kinda sucks for obvious reasons
(conventional schooling methods are garbage
and I learn better by just building things).

If you stumble across my work, just know I'm
using this GitHub account to play around with
the tools I currently have at my disposal
(for now). Hopefully I can get good at this 
shit and actually make something of value.

Thanks for stopping by,
Christian
